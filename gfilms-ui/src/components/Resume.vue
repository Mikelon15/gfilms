                    With a close friend, I volunteered to create a promotional video for a charter
                    school that
                    focuses on teaching children in impoverished
                    communities. This is the first video I made for an organization.

                <p>
                    I recently got a position with the marketing department at the
                    YMCA creating videos which promote programs and specific areas of the YMCA. I
                    create my own schedule for work which allows me to develop my own sense of
                    responsibility and accountability. Aside from this, I am able to learn from
                    those who are in top positions in a company.

                    Youth and Government has been a major part of my life since Sophomore
                    year of high school. I participated for three years making sure to do my best
                    in every aspect. Participating in national events, I have gone to North
                    Carolina and Washington D.C. Youth and Government has been formative in my
                    perspective of the world. I do not just want to live in it; I want to help
                    change it for the better.
