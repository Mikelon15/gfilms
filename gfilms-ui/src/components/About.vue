        <h3>
            Raised in Phoenix, I first delved into film my sophomore year along with Youth and Government.
        </h3>

        <h3>
            I became passionate about sharing my views, and I learned to express myself through my content.
            My passion developed
            with every film video created with. That passion then transformed into making videos for
            non-profits. My first
            advertisement video was one made with a friend for a charter school called Vista College
            Preparatory in an impoverished
            part of Phoenix. Afterwards, I created a video for a YMCA award ceremony. The project led to me
            being able to attain a
            job at the YMCA as a videographer and cinematographer.
        </h3>

        <h3>
            My passion for film and political advocacy continues to drive me forward. I not only want to
            make films, but I want to
            make films that matter. That is why I have worked with nonprofits and hope to make more
            creative films that have an
            impact.
